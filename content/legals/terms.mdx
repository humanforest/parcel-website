# Terms of Service

## 1. Introduction

These terms govern our provision of delivery services via parcel.humanforest.co.uk (Site). The Site is operated by or on behalf of HumanForest (Bikes) Limited trading as HumanForest (HumanForest, we, us and our). We are a limited company, registered in England. Our registered company number is 14417600, and our registered office is at 207 Southwark Bridge Road, London, England, SE1 0DN. We are a member of CoMo UK. Our VAT registration number is 343882480.

Your access to and/or use of the Site, and your purchase and use of any of the Services (as defined below) is subject to these terms and by placing an order for and/or using any Services you agree to be bound by them. You should print a copy of these terms for future reference. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not use the Site or Services.

Use of your personal information submitted to or via the Site when utilising the Services is governed by our Privacy and Cookies Policy.

## 2. Registering with Us

To use the Services, you must first register to set up an account with us by completing the account registration form available through the Site. You only need to register once.

To register with us you must be at least 18 years of age (or any older age legally required under local law to bind yourself legally to these terms).

Please note that additional eligibility criteria may apply to a particular Service, where indicated on the Site. It is your responsibility to ensure you satisfy all of the minimum eligibility criteria before choosing to purchase the Service. By doing so, you confirm to us that you do meet all of the minimum eligibility criteria.

You agree to provide accurate, complete and up-to-date contact information when registering with us, including your name, mobile phone number and email address. In order to process your order we will also require payment details from you (including credit / debit card information) (Payment Card).You can choose whether you wish to save your Payment Card details to your account for future use.

We will also require you to accept these terms and our Privacy Policy which can be found [here](/privacy-policy).

You must promptly update your account information within the Site in the event of any changes to the information provided.

Registration is subject to approval by us in all cases, and we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to decline any application for registration, without giving a reason. If we approve your registration, you will receive a notification email from us.

We reserve the right, in our discretion, to carry out checks (including checks with credit reference agencies) for the purposes of confirming your identity and to establish your creditworthiness. By agreeing to these terms, you agree to our doing so.

We take fraud seriously, both for your protection and ours. If we suspect that any information you have provided to us is inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent, we may suspend or terminate your account if and until the issue is resolved. During that time, you will lose access to the Site and/or our Services, either temporarily or permanently.

## 3. Email and password

Upon registration for an account with us, you will be asked to enter your email and create a password. You must keep your email and password confidential at all times and use it only to access and use your account and not for any other purpose. You are the only authorised user of your account and, accordingly, you must not disclose your email and/or password to anyone else. You should contact us immediately upon discovering any unauthorised use of your account or error in the operation of your username and/or password (see Support). Any breach of these terms and/or any use of your account by anyone to whom you disclose your email and/or password will be treated as if the breach or use had been carried out by you and will not relieve you of your obligations to us.

You must cease to use and delete the password for your account upon termination of your account for whatever reason.

## 4. Our Services

The intention of our Site is to connect you with a rider who will collect a parcel (on your behalf) and deliver this to you (or another recipient of your choosing) using our e-bikes, e-mopeds or the rider's own bike (Services).

We warrant that the Services will be provided with reasonable care and skill.

In order for us to provide you with the Services, you must provide us with details of your required collection and delivery, as indicated on the Site at the time of booking including:

- Collection address (Collection Location);
- Delivery address (Delivery Location);
- Full name and phone number of sender
- Full name and phone number of intended recipient; and
- Estimated weight of the parcel.

If you do not provide this information, we will not be able to provide you with the Services.

Once you have submitted your order and that order has been accepted (see [section 4.1 below](#4_1)) we will issue you with an email confirming your order has been accepted (Booking Confirmation). Once a rider has accepted your order, contact details of the rider who will be collecting and delivering your parcel, as well as location details for that rider will be sent to you.

### 4.1 Collection and delivery

Once you have placed an order and it has been accepted by a rider, the rider will attempt to deliver your parcel to the address provided as soon as practicable. Upon successful delivery the rider is required to take a photo of the parcel at the Delivery Location as proof of delivery.

We cannot guarantee that a rider will be available to provide the Services or will accept your order in any event.

If you place an order through our Site and your order is not accepted by one of the riders, the order can be cancelled and you will be issued a full refund for your uncompleted order. In the rare case where the rider accepts your order and the delivery of the parcel is not made within a reasonable timeframe, you should contact HumanForest customer services and if we agree, in our sole discretion, that the delivery has not been made within a reasonable timeframe, we will cancel your order and issue a refund to you in respect of your uncompleted order.

If you are not able to take receipt of the delivery you should clearly specify a secure location for the rider to leave the package in the notes section of your order. You accept that, upon delivery at your chosen secure location, delivery has been completed and we are no longer liable for your parcel.

The rider has the right to refuse delivery if the parcel breaches sections 4.2 and 5.1 below.

### 4.2 Parcels We may not be able to accept

Riders may not be able to accept collection and delivery, and retain the right to reject your delivery, if:

- items are too large to safely transport using our vehicles or their own bikes;
- there are multiple items in one delivery;
- the item is not securely packaged for delivery;
- the item value exceeds £100;
- the item contains prohibited items (as defined in section 5.1); or
- the sender takes an unreasonable amount of time (more than 5 minutes) to hand over the package.

You must provide accurate details of your parcel when placing your order; if accurate details are not provided and the rider accepts your order but is unable to transport your parcel, you will be notified that the Services cannot be completed, and you may still be charged for the Services.

### 4.3 Amending delivery details

If you wish to make any amendments to your order prior to the rider accepting your order, then you can do this via the Site. If you wish to make any amendments to your order after the rider accepts your delivery, then you will need to first cancel your order and re-issue the order with the amended details. You can cancel your order at any time before the rider arrives at the Collection Location. Once an order has been collected from the Collection Location by a rider, you must contact HumanForest customer support if you wish to cancel your order. In such circumstances, we cannot, however, guarantee that it will be possible to cancel the order before delivery.

If you are unable to amend your order once it has been accepted by a rider and it is not possible to complete the delivery (e.g. because there is no one at the Delivery Location) , you will still be charged for the Services.

### 4.4 Failed delivery

The rider will make reasonable efforts to deliver the parcel to the Delivery Location however if you/your nominated recipient are unable to take receipt of the parcel for any reason, including where:

- the door is not answered;
- you do not provide a secure location to leave the parcel; or
- it is not clear where delivery should be made to despite Delivery Address being provided (e.g. where the Delivery Location is a block of flats but the flat number is unknown)
- the rider will attempt to contact you (using the details provided when you placed the order or that you have provided on the Site) in order to arrange an alternative location for the rider to deliver the parcel to.

If the rider is unable to deliver the parcel, and is unable to contact you/your nominated recipient, after 5 minutes at the Delivery Location the delivery will be deemed as having failed and the rider will return the parcel to the Collection Location and if this is not possible, deliver it to Human Forest's headquarters.

If delivery fails in accordance with the above, you will still be charged for the Services (and any additional journeys that the rider has to make to deliver the parcel to you at an alternative location or to the Collection Location or the Human Forest headquarters).

We will not be liable or responsible for any failure by a rider to deliver the parcel if you/your intended recipient is not able to take receipt of the delivery for any reason.

If the parcel is returned to the Collection Location, we will no longer be responsible or liable for the safety or security of the parcel.

## 5 Your obligations

You warrant that you have the required authority to order the collection of the parcel from, and delivery to, the relevant address. Where necessary you must have liaised with the collection point prior to collection to permit them to release the parcel to the rider.

You must provide us with all the information requested by us (including on the Site) in order to ensure we can provide you with the Services.

You must ensure that you/your intended recipient are available to take receipt of the parcel. If you are not available the rider may not be able to deliver the parcel to you and the provisions of section 4.4 shall apply.

### 5.1 What you must NOT do

You must NOT use our Services or the Site in connection with the violation of any law.

You must NOT use the Services to transport any of the following items: (i) illegal items; (ii) firearms, weaponry, ammunition, and their parts; (iii) batteries; (iv) highly perishable food or beverages (e.g. raw meat or dairy products); (v) pharmaceutical products, over-the-counter medications, vitamins or supplements; (vi) recreational drugs, drug paraphernalia, or tobacco products; (vii) money, gift-cards, lottery tickets or transferable securities; (viii) dangerous and hazardous items including explosives, corrosives, items that are poisonous or flammable, medical waste, environmental waste, infectious substances and other dangerous or hazardous items as described in applicable law; (ix) stolen goods; (x) fragile items; (xi) obscene publications and unlawful indecent images; (xii) animals and (xiii) alcohol (Prohibited Items).

You must NOT tamper with, vandalise or try to gain unauthorised access to the Site, including by removing or changing any content of the Site or attempting to circumvent security or interfere with the proper working of the Site or the servers on which it is hosted or seeking to store content of the Site on a server or other storage device connected to a network or create an electronic database by systematically downloading and storing all of the content of the Site.

You must NOT create links to the Site from any other website, without our prior written consent.

You must not, nor allow anyone else to, use your account, any Service or the Site:

- to access or attempt to access any Service which you have not purchased;
- to interfere with or disrupt the provision of any Service, the Site or use any Service or the Site in a way that interferes with anyone else’s use of any Service or the Site;
- to further any criminal or fraudulent activity or to impersonate another person;
- to breach the rights of any person (including, but not limited to rights of privacy and intellectual property rights); or
- otherwise in breach of any acceptable use guidelines that we may issue from time to time.

You must NOT use the Service or Site in a way that might damage our name or reputation or that of any of our affiliates.

You must NOT share the contact details of any rider with a third party (other than the intended recipient of the parcel if this is not you) and you must not use the rider's contact details for any reason other than to enable you to receive the Services and take delivery of the parcel.

## 6. External links

The Site may, from time to time, include links to external sites, which may include links to third party offers and promotions. We include these links to provide you with access to information, products or services that you may find useful or interesting. We are not responsible for the content of these sites or for any information, products or services provided via such sites and do not guarantee that they will be continuously available. The fact that we include links to such external sites does not imply any endorsement of, or association with, their operators or promoters.

## 7. Charges and payment

The charges for Services are as quoted on the Site. Charges include VAT. Please note that we may change the pricing in respect of our Services as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business and without prior notice to you.

Whilst charges are liable to change at any time, changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you an Booking Confirmation.

We accept payment by most major credit and debit cards. Please note that, for security reasons, the statement address for the Payment Card you use to pay must be the same as your contact address for the order. You may only use a payment method that you have the legal right to use, and you authorise us to charge this payment method for any charges that you incur.

All payments to us are made through a third-party payment processor (i.e. payments are accepted by them on our behalf). Our third-party payment processor is Stripe who collects and holds your payment information. By registering a Payment Card, you agree that this can be used to pay for relevant fees incurred when booking the Services.

You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.

During the registration process, when you first add your Payment Card details to your account, a pre-authorisation or temporary hold of £0.60 will be placed on your payment method. This hold ensures that your payment method is active. It will show up as a ''pending'' transaction on your bank statement and will never actually be charged. This will only occur at one time, during the registration process. Please note: The timeframe of this release can vary, we encourage you to check with your bank to understand their policies on pre-authorisation holds.

You are responsible for all charges to your account. If you have questions regarding charges to your account, you should contact us (see Support). If you disagree with any charges we have made to your account, you must let us know as soon as possible after you have become aware of the issue. To resolve any disputed charges, we will need certain information about your collection and delivery.

We will endeavour to take payment in respect of all charges to your account from the same Payment Card that you have previously paid with (unless you have provided details of an alternative Payment Card in your name that we should use). You authorise us, on an ongoing basis, to debit that Payment Card (or, if relevant, the alternative Payment Card) automatically with all charges due and payable by you in relation to any Service in accordance with these terms, until that Service is cancelled, or your account is closed.

If you do not pay us charges that you owe to us on time (including if any correct charge to your Payment Card is not authorised), we may suspend or terminate your access to the Site or any Service (and we reserve the right to pursue any available legal remedy to collect the amount owed by you). However, charges will continue to be incurred until the account is closed.

From time to time we may run promotions where we issue discount codes. These can be used in part-payment of the charges for the Service(s) ordered through the Site, subject to the terms under which the discounts are issued (as indicated in our relevant promotion from which you received the code) (Promotional Terms). The Promotional Terms may require your agreement before taking part in the applicable promotions. Discount codes can only be used once, are only redeemable via the Site/Application and are only valid during the period of validity stated and only in respect of the relevant Service(s) stated. Discount codes cannot be redeemed for cash. Any discount codes you accrue will be used on a first in-first out basis in the order in which you have accrued them.

The revised version of our terms will be effective when posted on the Site. The revised terms will supersede any previous versions in respect of new orders.
