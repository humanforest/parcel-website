## 4. Why and how do we use your personal data and what is our "lawful basis" for doing so?

We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Whenever we process your personal data, we are required to identify and maintain a valid "lawful basis" (i.e. a legally compliant justification) for the processing. To help you to understand what we do with data and why, we have described the various relevant lawful bases that we rely on in the table below. Where we rely on our legitimate interests, we will always make sure that we balance these interests against your rights.

## 6. What if you fail to provide personal data?

Please make sure you provide us with certain information when requested as if you don't we may not be able to perform the contract we have entered into with you (such as, to provide you with services). In this case, we may have to cancel a service you have with us, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

## 7. Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it. If we need to use your personal data for a purpose other than that for which it was collected, we will provide you, prior to that further processing, with information about the new purpose, we will explain our legal justification for doing so and we will provide you with any relevant further information. We may also issue a new privacy policy to you.

## 8. How we share your personal data

### Third party suppliers and service providers involved in our contractual relationship with you

Like most businesses, we work with third party suppliers and service providers as part of the day to day operations of our business. Some of these trusted suppliers will process your personal data on our behalf and provide services to us such as the provision of CRM services (and associated applications) which enable us to manage web hosting, marketing, order fulfilment, and so on.

We may also share your personal data with digital marketing agencies, print media agencies and events and PR agencies (including customer/influencer personal contact details and addresses) to send gifts, promotions and invites to events and for other marketing purposes.

All card transactions are managed by trusted, certified and legally authorised partners who are responsible for ensuring that your payment details remain secure during the payment process.

We will always make sure that these trusted suppliers meet agreed standards for the protection of your personal data and they will only ever be allowed to use your personal data in order to provide us with services and not for their own commercial purposes. We require all third parties to take appropriate technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal information and to treat it subject to a duty of confidentiality and in accordance with applicable data protection law.

### Other scenarios in which we might share your personal data

We may also share your personal information:

- with our group companies;
- with government authorities or professional bodies, such as HM Revenue & Customs in the United Kingdom (for tax purposes);
- with our professional advisors including tax, legal or other corporate advisors who provide professional services to us;
- with regulators, law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies, as well as our legal advisers, courts, the police and any other authorised law enforcement bodies, for the purposes of investigating any actual or suspected criminal activity or other regulatory or legal matters etc.;
- in the event that we consider selling or buying any business or assets we will disclose your personal information to any prospective sellers or buyers of such business or assets;
- in the event of any insolvency situation (e.g. administration or liquidation);
- if we, or substantially all of our assets, are acquired by a third party, in which case your personal information will be one of the transferred assets;
- to protect the rights, property or safety of our employees, workers, contractors, clients, or others. This includes exchanging your personal information with other companies and organisations (including without limitation the local police or other local law enforcement agencies) for the purposes of our employee, worker, contractor and client safety, crime prevention, fraud protection and credit risk reduction; or
- if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation or regulatory requirements, or otherwise for the prevention or detection of fraud or crime.

## 9. How do we protect your personal data?

We take the security of your personal data very seriously and have put in place physical, technical, operational and administrative strategies, controls and measures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure as required by law and in accordance with accepted good industry practice. We will always keep these under review to make sure that the measures we have implemented remain appropriate. You can obtain further information about these measures using the contact details set out at part 17 of this privacy policy below.

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees and other third parties who have a business need to know in order to perform their job duties and responsibilities. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

## 10. How long do we keep your personal data?

We will retain your personal data for as long as we need it in connection with our relationship with you. This retention period may depend on whether you are visiting our Site or making a purchase and on whether we need to retain your personal data in order to comply with applicable laws.

Personal data which is no longer to be retained will be securely and effectively destroyed or permanently erased from our IT systems and we will also require third parties to destroy or erase such personal data where applicable. Your full payment card details are captured only for the purposes of processing your transaction and are not stored, sold or rented by us. Your full payment card details are not available to our staff.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it can no longer be associated with you. In this case, we may retain such information for a longer period without further notice to you.

## 11. Your rights in relation to your personal data

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes so that our records can be updated. We cannot be held responsible for any errors in your personal information in this regard unless you have notified us of the relevant change.

Data protection law grants you a number of specific rights in respect of your data in addition to the broad and general right to have your data protected. We have set out some information in respect of each of those specific rights, below:

- **Right to be informed** about how your personal information will be processed. This enables you to receive information about how we use your personal information. We have set this information out in this policy.
- **Request access to your personal information** (commonly known as a "**data subject access request**"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
- **Request correction** of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
- **Request erasure** of your personal information (commonly known as the "**right to be forgotten**"). This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
- **Object to processing** of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
- **Request the restriction of processing** of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
- **Request the transfer** of your personal information to another party.
- **Not to be subject to a decision solely based on automated processing**. We do not anticipate making decisions about you based solely on automated decision making where that decision would have a significant impact on you. If we ever make a decision about you automatically by a computer or an algorithm without human intervention you can ask us to have that decision reviewed by a human.

If you want to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us (using the contact details set out at part 17 of this privacy policy below).

## 12. Where your personal data may be processed

Given the international location of some of our clients and suppliers, your personal information may be transferred in and out of the UK or the European Economic Area ("**EEA**"). where local laws may not provide legal protection for personal data in the same way as is applicable in the UK or the EEA. Where your personal information is processed outside of the UK and EEA, we will ensure that we take the necessary steps to protect your personal information as required by data protection laws.
