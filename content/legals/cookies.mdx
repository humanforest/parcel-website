You may not have given any thought to how websites use data to improve their services, measure how popular the site is, or make sure that you receive content or digital adverts of interest to you.

These processes require information to be collected and processed. This commonly includes information about the devices you use (such as laptops and mobile phones), your location and information obtained from your browsing activities. This information is collected using cookies (small files of data sent by a website) and other similar technologies such as tag, pixels and device identifiers which are deployed on or collected from your device when you land on a website or access content through a mobile app.

For the purposes of this cookie policy, we use the term "cookie" to cover our use of all types of similar technology used to monitor online activity, including cookies, tags, pixels and beacons. We hope that this policy helps you understand and feel more confident about our use of cookies.

## This policy

This is the cookie policy for the HumanForest website and mobile application (together, this/our "**Site**") and associated Site customer service channels. We hope that it helps you to understand our use of cookies. You can read more about our use of personal data in our privacy policy, here.

Our Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our Site and also allows us to improve our Site and our services since we can learn about what interests our website visitors and â€“ just as importantly â€“ what doesn't.

This policy also covers the cookies that we place in our marketing emails. This helps us to understand which emails are opened, which are ignored, and which types of content prompts people to click through to our Site.

The types of cookies that we use:

- **Strictly required cookies:** these are cookies that are _required_ for the operation of our Site. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site or use shopping baskets.
- **Analytics and statistics cookies:** these allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Site works and your shopping experience, for example, by ensuring that you are finding what you are looking for easily. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous (i.e. we could not identify you as an individual using the data).
- **Functional cookies**: these are used to recognise you when you return to our Site. This enables us to personalise our content for you and remember your preferences. For example, if we know that you are interested in a certain product or service, we would present this prominently on the Site for you. They also enable us to remember details such as your user name, language or location to make your browsing experience simpler and easier.
- **Marketing and retargeting cookies**: These cookies record your visit to our Site, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Site more relevant to your interests and to deliver adverts relevant to you. In addition, these cookies limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as helping us measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. We may also share this information with third parties (such as our third-party advertising partners) for this purpose.

Some of the cookies that we use are deleted when you close your browser. These cookies are known as **'session cookies'**.

Some other cookies have a longer lifetime (which varies cookie by cookie) and will be stored on your device until their expiration date. These are known as **'persistent cookies'**.

## Third party cookies

Authorised third parties may also use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies for storing information on our Site.

For example, we use Google Analytics to learn how visitors are using our Site and how we could improve it. You can find out more about Google Analytics by clicking [here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). We use Facebook pixel which enables us to measure, optimise and build audiences for our advertising campaigns. In addition, these third party service providers may help us and you to avoid fraud.

By using our Site, you agree that we and authorised third parties can place the types of cookies described above on your device and access them whenever you visit the Site or other websites operated by us.

## Managing cookies

We have deployed a cookie "consent management platform" which means that you will normally see a message on our Site before we place cookies on your device or browser. The message will describe the types of cookies we use and what information they might collect. **We will not place (and we won't permit third parties to place) cookies other than "strictly necessary" cookies on your device or browser when using our Site unless you have told us that you are happy to do so using the consent management platform. You can update your preferences at any time by clicking here.**

You can also block cookies by using your browser settings. However, if you use your browser settings to block _all_ cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Site.

## More information

If you would like further information about our use of cookies and similar technologies, you can contact our Data Protection Representative at privacy@humanforest.co.uk. You can also find more information about our use of personal data by reading our privacy policy which is available here.
